## Description
This program is a command-line README file generator for your projects. It streamlines the process of creating a well-structured README file by prompting you with questions about your project. It then generates a README file with the information you provide. A well-documented README file is essential for sharing your project with others, making it easier for them to understand, use, and contribute to your work.
